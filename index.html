            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there, I'm Patrick. I'm a rising 3rd year at Berkeley studying EECS and Applied Math. 
                Currently, my interests lie within the intersection of Computer Science and Math such as Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. In particular, I'm very interested in Adversarial Machine Learning.
                If I needed to describe myself in one word it would be tenacious.
            </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Stripe - Software Engineer Intern</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
                Developed and deployed a Flink Application that identifes and auto-terminates degraded Hadoop nodes
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduced degraded node identification and termination for an on-call Engineer from 45 to 0 minutes, a 100% improvement in response time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Decreased the number of pages an on-call Engineer would receive for potentially degraded Hadoop nodes from 30 pages to 9 pages, a 70% reduction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrated the AWS Support API to automatically create support tickets for degraded nodes, once they were
                terminated.
            </li>
           </ul>

           <h3>RISING Lab, University of Florida - Undergraduate Research Assistant </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
                Developed Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) trajectories in Reduced Speed Work Zones (RSWZ)
            </li>
            <li>
                Simulated and explored various attack methodologies in V2I/V2X communications for CAV trajectories
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked presented at the ACM MobiHoc 2023 Conference and published in the ACM Digital Library
            </li>
           </ul>

           <h3>ACE Lab, UC Berkeley - Undergraduate Research Assistant </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
                Developed a cheat-detection program using the five indicators of cheating for take-home exams for PrairieLearn
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimized the runtime of the program from 60s to 10s, an 83% reduction in runtime
            </li>
            <li>
                Work presented at the SIGCSE 2023 TS and published in the ACM Digital Library
            </li>
           </ul>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Quantitative Trading Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implemented a quant trading strategy rooted in VIX pricing, VIX futures contango, VolDex pricing, and the S&P 500
Developed 10 key metrics that would be converted into a weighted average, then transformed into a percentile rank to determine what strategy should be taken for a particular trading day
                </li>
                <li>
                    Built a web scraper using Selenium to collect VIX Term Structure data (historical prices, VIX futures contract expiration dates, and VIX futures contango) since 2007
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilized Pandas and NumPy to integrate data from distinct sources characterized by their different formats
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2D Tile Exploration Engine</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration engine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilized the Gaussian pseudorandom number generator to create random yet predictable worlds based on the inputted seed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a loading and saving mechanism to the game by detailing a user’s current state in the world into a text file.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Style Transfer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implemented an image generator that creates a new image that has content from a “content” image with style from a “style” image
                </li>
                <li>
                    Built a custom cost model for Neural Style Transfer for the VGG-19 network from scratch, and defined content and style layers
                </li>
            </ul>
